# Markowitz-Minimum-Variance-Gradient-Boosting-Portfolio-Optimization
This project combines portfolio optimization based on Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting) to predict future returns. The goal is to construct an efficient portfolio with minimum variance and optimal allocation of stocks.

**Objectives**
Build a Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) using historical stock data.
Optimize portfolio weights to minimize risk (variance) for a given expected return.
Apply Gradient Boosting Regression to forecast asset returns and improve portfolio allocation.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data analysis
yfinance – Fetching stock price data
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
SciPy – Optimization for portfolio weights
Scikit-learn – Gradient Boosting Regressor for prediction
